### Summary

This is an example how to use Apache Kafka with a Spring Boot Application, there are two main classes, the Sender, and the Receiver which are used to Produce and Consume Kafka Message, this implementation is using CLOUDKARAFKA  as Kafka Server and the SASL_SSL security protocol.

There is a Rest Service used to send a message to the Kafka Server and also there is a KafkaListener class which is receiving all the messages published on one topic.

### Project contents
The ports are set to the defaults of 8080 for http.

The Kafka configuration properties are in application.properties, there you can find all the CloudKarafka credentials you need full fill in order to configure the access to the Kafka Server

### Run

To build and run the application:
1. `mvn clean compile install`
